Hi and welcome to my website!

I'm Tam, and I'm currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I graduated from Quest University Canada in May 2019 with my focus in economics and predictive modeling. I wrote my bachelor [thesis](https://tamhn.me/project/) on maximizing business value with churn modeling.

Currently I'm seeking for a career path in growth marketing and website optimization. I recently graduated at CXL Institute as a growth marketing specialist ([certificate](https://certificates.cxl.com/a42f5bd6-a306-42df-b380-10c36e0e3d7c)).

This personal website contains a collection of my personal blogs and [work projects](https://tamhn.me/project/).

I'd love to chat with people and discuss about games, table tennis, writing, music, anime and books. Feel free to [email me](contact@tamhn.me) or connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamhnguyen179/).

This blog is built using Hugo with the Cupper theme. The repository is available on my [Github](https://github.com/tamdrashtri/tampersonalblog).
