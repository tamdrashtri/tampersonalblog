Hi and welcome to my website!

I'm Tam, and I'm currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I graduated from Quest University Canada and my focus was in economics and predictive modeling. I love to derive insights from data to drive business decisions. I wrote my bachelor [thesis](https://tamhn.me/project/) on maximizing business value with churn modeling. 

This personal website contains a collection of my personal blogs and [work projects](https://tamhn.me/project/).

I'd love to chat with people and discuss about games, table tennis, writing, music, anime and books. Feel free to [email me](mailto:nghtam179@gmail.com) or connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamhnguyen179/).

This blog is built using Hugo with the Cupper theme. The repository is available on my [Github](https://github.com/tamdrashtri/tampersonalblog).
