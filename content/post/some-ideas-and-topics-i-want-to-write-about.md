Some ideas and topics I want to write about:

* Traveling: should do this more often.
* Food: inspired by this [radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5goVI4T6I8) interviewing Dang Hong Quan (it's in Vietnamese), and this interesting [blog](https://xrdt.github.io) too.
* My college experience.
* Personal relationships, love.
* Films.
* Book reviews.
* Death, or how to live
* Spirituality
