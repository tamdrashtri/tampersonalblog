Some of my friends, notably H, are very good curators. Unfortunately she only shares her list on Messenger and not for the public. She often find great stuff and I learned a lot from them. I found it a little wasted. Sharing them publicly is a great way to archive those favorites things and initiate discussions with others.

What I found recently is that everyone can be a curator. If one finds something interesting, they can share it online and with others. It's a foundation and a jumping off point to write and start blogging, if one has no ideas to blog. Curating can be a hobby too, and it's not such time-consuming as writing. That's why my learning log is born, so even if I have nothing to write, I can just curate something and it becomes a post.

Just like drawing needs references, writers need materials and inspirations to write too. Since I use the Read-it-later apps I feel much more motivated to write. I see examples of people having their blogs and the value of these articles to my personal life. This makes me realize the more I read and like a medium (like blogging), the easier it is to start doing things like these bloggers because their blogs click to me.
