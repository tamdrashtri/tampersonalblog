Some of my friends, notably H, are very good curators. Unfortunately she only shares her list on Messenger and not for the public. She often find great stuff and I learned a lot from them. I found it a little wasted. Sharing them publicly is a great way to archive those favorites things and initiate discussions with others.

What I found recently is that everyone can be a curator. If one finds something interesting, they can share it online and with others. It's a foundation and a jumping-off point to write and start blogging, if one has no ideas to blog. Curating can be a hobby too, and it's not such time-consuming as writing. That's why my learning log is born, so even if I have nothing to write, I can just curate stuffs I enjoy reading and it becomes a post.

One needs to be a curator before becoming a creator. Just like drawing needs references, writers also need research and inspirations from other writers. Since I use Read-it-later apps and read more more blogs, I feel much more motivated to write. I've accumulated enough examples and references to start blogging.
