title: Migrating my blog to Hugo. Forestry is a great help!
draft: true

---
I just migrated my blog from Webflow to Hugo. I was hesitating for a long time since I don't want to open a code editor and encounter bugs along the way, and I may achieve nothing at all. Sometimes problems occur in a very small mistake and I could not debug it. I ended up deleting this blog four times to make it functional like now.

Webflow was great (i.e. I don't need to encounter bugs and I could exercise my own creativity by building themes), but they charged $6/month. I think for a small blog like mine then it's not really worth it. Even big websites are static, so I don't need complicate things if it's a blog. So I decide to build it on Hugo. I then searched google on content management for static sites and found Forestry.io. It provides me a great interface to add and edit contents, so I'm so grateful and satisfied with it now. Yet I've encounter some syncing mistakes while I was writing this article so everything has flaw-backs. At least it's better than none.
