title: No one uses Twitter in Vietnam!?

---
I spent a few hours in my life yesterday trying to find some individuals who write stuffs in Vietnamese on Twitter to follow, but I found none. Most Twitter users abandon their accounts after a few posts. 

This might be because they could not find much value in their Twitter accounts while Facebook has satisfied most of their objectives. Facebook has everything they want, even dating now. Love now is so accessible.

I might not even touch Twitter if I did not find many interesting individuals and influencers on this platform. It takes a while to find some of them. Initially my Twitter contained just retweets, things that I found interesting and valuable in terms of information. A month ago I started to tweet my own stuffs and I feel much more authentic and less generic. I'm learning to write succinctly and can be able to use for weekly summary. 

I also use Twitter for professional reasons, so that might explain why I stick with it. Everything on Twitter is public, and I'm forced to write things that have information value.
