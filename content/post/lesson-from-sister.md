title: 'A low cost, high retention and low-stress business: Lessons from my sister'

---
My sister used to be just a lower middle class woman. She does not earn much money, but had a pretty sustainable life compared to others, partly because she does not have to spend much money on renting, or food. 

  
She become increasingly interested in cosmetics. Her dressing room looks exactly like a laboratory where she tries every cosmetics to help her to improve her skin. She does have a lot of problems with her skin.   
‍  
The interesting thing is, she started to review a lot of products she bought online on a facebook group that has many members. She became the admin and is very active on that group. It gets more popular. Her public image becomes increasingly popular and she has a lot of followers on Facebook.   
‍  
Then she started to learn some skills to remove acne. She started to offer some people free services where she helped them with facial problems. A lot of friends follow her as as well, and they come to support her. Words of mouth started to spread. She gets more clients and her calendar got even busier.   
‍  
What she essentially has is become an influencer. Her voice starts to have authority. Things become so easy for her just to find clients. She know the pain points of her clients because she has the exact problems as them, so she has a bonus point on empathy too.

It attaches to the idea of tribe marketing. Once a person has 100 true fans, their businesses will become much less likely to die, not alone having very good profits from these people. This is the effect of words of mouth. These 100 fans will spread the good words to other people in their network.

Personal branding, therefore, is the foremost importance in this world of social media. I’m just given the advice that I should have at least 4 social accounts at minimum and should google myself at least once a month. 

  
Preparing for my career has become a milestone for me to share more online. Share what I read and considered as valuable. Share what’s not just fun but also informative. Do it because I like to share but not for money. It’s also virtue I learned from Book Hunter and other businesses making their business online and not work for anyone.
