My sister used to be a lower middle class woman. She has been an average employee, doing PR and translation works, and does not earn much money. Yet she has a peaceful life compared to others. The cost of living in Vietnam is amazingly cheap, and she does not have to spend any penny on renting.

She became increasingly interested in cosmetics a few years back when she realizes she has some skin problems. Her dressing room looks exactly like a laboratory where she tries every cosmetics and products to help improve her skin.   
‍  
The interesting thing is, she started to review a lot of products she bought online on a Facebook beauty group that has many members. She became the admin and has been very active on that group. It gets more popular. Her public image becomes increasingly popular and she has a lot of followers on Facebook.  
‍  
Then she started to learn some skills to remove acne. She offered some people free services where she helped them with facial problems. A lot of friends follow her, some get to know her from her reviews, and they come to support her. Words of mouth started to spread. She has gotten more clients.   
‍  
What makes her so successful is so simple that I surprise: becoming an influencer. Her opinions starts to have authority. Things become so easy for her just to find clients. She know the pain points of her clients because she has the exact problems as them, so she has a bonus point on empathy too.

It attaches to the idea of tribe marketing. Once a person has 100 true fans, their businesses will become much less likely to die, not alone having very good profits from these people. This is the effect of words of mouth. These 100 fans will spread the good words to other people in their network. Some examples of this model include [Forte](https://www.fortelabs.co).

Personal branding, therefore, is the foremost importance in this world of social media. I’m just given the advice that I should have at least 4 social accounts at minimum and should google myself at least once a month.

Preparing for career has become my milestone to share what I read and consider as valuable. Share things are not just fun but also informative. Do it because I like to share but not for money. It’s also virtue I learned from Book Hunter and other businesses making their business online and not work for anyone.
