When I first started learning data analytics I assumed one only has to know SQL, R and Excel. Business understanding is often quite undervalued. I stressed too much on technical skills without bothering learning domain knowledge like marketing. Throughout my interview processes in data analytics, I figured out some candidates can gain tremendous competitive advantages against other people who have excellent technical skills but without domain knowledge.

I then tried to find some marketing online programs to gain more practical skills. Some other marketing programs can be very theoretical like on Coursera, and some are incredibly expensive, like DemandCurve with the cost of $15000. Some on Udemy turn people into passive learners by just throwing lectures and contents without any projects or practices. This can work for some people who want to apply their knowledge directly or want to create their own contents. But for people who want to build their portfolio or want to expand their career, these courses are not enough.

When I considered these different learning options, though Udacity is not cheap either considering it's an online course, I think it's still quite worth it because more often than not, one learns the content by applying the knowledge in the lectures. The course team designs homework and projects that force students to listen to the lectures and apply knowledge in the project.

So, although the content taught in this Digital Marketing Nanodegree might also be given elsewhere like colleges or accredited programs, but what added to the uniqueness and core value is the projects I can apply and build my portfolio. Gaining domain knowledge in marketing to support data analytics and building my portfolio in a short time, thus, are the two main reasons I bear the cost to take this program.
