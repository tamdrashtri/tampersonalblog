It's questionable how much I learned from classes at Quest. When I first came to Quest, it was allowing me so much more opportunities to meet people with different backgrounds than mine, though they have similarities such as their belief systems or such.

But universities opened up my mind not much of the academic aspect, but more of a social aspect. Some people just catch my attention, some creative, some deeply vulnerable, showing me the world is very much diverse and I can't be friends with everyone in the world. Some close friends of mine taught me a lot about love, passion, or just developing their passion by having a Youtube-like channel and reached 10000 fans with some hardcore fans designing and drawing video covers for her. This is impressive to see how they changed over time and can practice storytelling using games. Those storytellers rule the world. Just like drawing and creating stories do the same thing. Now people in the modern world can find their forms of storytelling through pictures and videos. Instagram and Youtube therefore are the epitome of storytelling and sharing contents. And I feel one would be so selfish if they do not have their blogs or videos or some forms of pictures sharing online, sharing their ways of thinking about the world. This is extremely valuable, just like my friend does with her channel, being able to travel with her fans and reach a lot of audiences are just amazing to see.

So seeing the examples of friends really open my up about the world in general, realizing that there are many different ways to live and thrive and think. Having creative friends get me to know more about the world. And there're a good number of artists here, though their skills are not officially trained in an art school or such. I just feel like my close friend could be a game artist if she likes to spend 2 years training in an art school specialized in that, but she seems not very into it either.
