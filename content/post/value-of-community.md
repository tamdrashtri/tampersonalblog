It's questionable how much I've learned from classes at Quest. Those classes are mostly basic and can be reproducible as online courses.

But universities, especially for liberal arts colleges, open up my mind not much of the academic aspect, but more of a social aspect. It allowed me so many opportunities to meet people with different backgrounds, though at the end I feel they have many similarities such as their belief systems or such. Some people just catch my attention, some creative, some deeply vulnerable, showing me the world is very much diverse and I can't be compatible with everyone. 

Some close friends of mine have been a great inspiration to me. It taught me a lot about love, or developing passion by having a Youtube-like channel in China and reached 10000 fans with some hardcore fans designing and drawing video covers for her for free. This is impressive to see how they've developed themselves over time and can practice storytelling using games. Those storytellers rule the world. Just like drawing and creating stories do the same thing. Now people can find their forms of storytelling through pictures and videos, just by having a laptop. Instagram and Youtube therefore are the epitomes of storytelling and sharing contents. And I feel it would be so wasted if everyone does not have blogs or videos or some forms of pictures sharing their ways of thinking about the world. This is extremely valuable, just like my friend does with her channel. Being able to travel with her fans and reach a lot of audiences are just amazing to see.

So seeing the examples of friends really open my up about the world in general, realizing that there are many different ways to live, thrive and think. And there're a good number of artists here, though their skills are not officially trained in an art school or such. I just feel like my close friend could be a game artist if she likes to spend 2 years training in an art school specialized in that, but she seems not very into it either.
