* Makes me remember how hard it is for gay people to find a long-term partner. I mean, it may take years before they find one, and it's no guarantee of the future.
* Anh Hung is an example. If he is not gay, he might have a wonderful girlfriend, but he cannot just change himself to like a girl. It just does not happen that way. He is struggling to find one for him, and might have been single for years. It's not easy.
