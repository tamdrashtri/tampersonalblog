I remembered when I was 9 or 10 my sister used to be obsessed with Yahoo 360, and a lot of her friends use them frequently. She met a lot of people via this site too and her social life had been very active. Does this lifestyle still happen now? I'm a more reserved and introvert so I feel I do not go out as much as her though I do go outside a lot. I'm contradicting myself here.

But that era was flourishing since so many people were publishing high quality contents, longer blog posts. I could customize them the themes too and it had provided so many great articles on the internet. Now Facebook allows people to write such short sentences and no one is willing to write long posts anymore. This type of design relieves the pressure to sit for hours writing a blog, yet it also makes people more lazy since they do not have to explain themselves or write more thoughtful contents. 

So I miss Yahoo 360 a lot. It did not have archives of blogs either. A lot of people love blogging migrated their contents to Wordpress, but I do think Yahoo 360 has a greater community and better social media than Wordpress.
