I remembered when I was 9 or 10 my sister used to be obsessed with Yahoo 360, and a lot of her friends use them frequently. She met a lot of people via this site too and her social life had been very active. Does this lifestyle still happen now? I'm a more reserved and introvert so I feel I do not go out as much as her though I do go outside a lot. I'm contradicting myself here.

But that era was flourishing since so many people were publishing high quality contents, longer blog posts. I could customize them the themes and so many great articles were published there. Now Facebook allows people to write such short sentences and no one is willing to write long posts. This type of design relieves the pressure to sit for hours writing a blog, yet it also makes people more lazy since they do not have to explain themselves or write thoughtful contents.

So I miss Yahoo 360 a lot. It did not have archives of blogs so there is no way to access them. A lot of people love blogging migrated their contents to Wordpress at the end.
