The basic ideas of this course is about understanding the customer journey and guide customers via that journey, leading to sales. It also provides structured guidelines on how to run an effective Facebook campaigns using videos and other medias.

I found this course high relevant, but I'm not sure if I can implement the same formula as his. Some of his advice are super specific, such as using Facebook Live

### Notes

**What Facebook wants us to do:**

1. **Adopt a full funnel strategy**: use different campaign
2. **Leverage all three targeting options**: core audiences, customer audience, lookalike audience
3. Drive reached audience down the funnel by retarget video viewers and websites visitors

**TOFU**:

1. The idea behind TOFU is to begin building trust by helping the prospect with questions related to the issue that you can help them solve.
2. The content may not talk about the exact problems your product solves—and that’s a good thing!

**MOFU**:

1. In the Middle of the funnel your prospects are aware of the solutions to their problem. •
2. They are more interested than prospects in the TOFU, but need to be nurtured further before making a buying decision. •
3. Content for the MOFU should be educational and entertaining, and also introduce more information about your brand’s solutions.

**BOFU**: BOFU content is for people who have considered their options and are ready to make a buying decision. At this point people may be choosing between you and another solution. Content for BOFU should be encourage clicks to your sales/cart page, or to purchase through ManyChat if you have that functionality set up.

**The rule of 7**: "The Rule of 7 is a marketing principle that states that your prospects need to come across your offer at least seven times before they really notice it and start to take action.”

#### Types of audience

**Custom audiences**: these are going to be the audiences thatwe are going to re-target.This is going to be our middle of funnel. 

**Look alike audiences**: now we're going to grow look alike audiences that are look alikes of people who,depending on whatever our goal is,they could be people who look alike purchases,look alike leads.This could be look alike video views.Now, I will tell you this.A lot of people understand what look alike audiences are,but they do have a misunderstanding,and in my opinion, they overuse look alike audiences,and essentially, it comes down to un-training the pixel.Or, polluting the pixel, however you want to say that.

**Core audiences**: is a targeting option that allows advertisers to reach precise audiences based on four main targeting options.Location, demographic, interest, and behaviors.

**_Why do we want to use core audiences?_** Well, the first thing is we really want to train the pixel.We want to target people based on age,location, hobbies.Now, what I like to do is every single month, I'm coming up with four new core audience.What I'm doing is a lot of research into the psyche of my possible customer.For instance, what magazines may they read?What news stations may they watch?What TV shows may they watch?

the reason we want to use custom audiences is'cause we're going to target people at very specific steps that they take along the customer journey.

**Hot 7 and Hot 28**

**The HOT7**: is every conceivable way we can retarget someoneover the course of 7 days

So I want you to think about anyone who goes to your sales page the last 7 days.Anybody who watches any of your sales videos the last 7 days.Anybody who engages with any content that would be related to your sales.Well, that's who you're going to retarget in 7 days.It's going to be the warmest and most engaged audience out there. And advertising to these audiences is going to be the least expensive way to keep people from engaged and indoctrinate them in the products and services that you offer.

**Belief**

**_They may not aware the problem exist_:** B is for belief.At this stage of the customer journey,they may or may not be aware that they have a problem.They maybe or may not know that you have a solution for that problem or that your product or service could even solve that problem.So it's our job to help them to begin to believe that there is a problem and it can be solved.How do we do this?It's actually a lot simpler than most people think.

**_Watching content means they are interested_:** I'm not retargeting them,but if they're watching the content,I know that they're interested in the content.Many times without a link,people are watching this for pennies.
