I'm having automatic behaviors that are not charming. Like saying 'really' or 'but' too often, interrupting what others are saying, not knowing what to ask to get to know people better or knowing how to build rapport. I have so much knowledge-gap.

Difficulties come, and mind attacks come to challenge me. A lot of times I feel so weak, wondering why things have turned out this way, or imagining negative events. Then I turned to myself and reminded that this is an opportunity to grow and to dis-identify with the minds. It's so negative that it wants to kill me. When I'm free of the mind, I feel love and there is no problem at all. Things happen when there are mind attacks.
