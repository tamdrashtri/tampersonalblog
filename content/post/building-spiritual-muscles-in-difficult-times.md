Difficulties come, and mind attacks come to challenge me. A lot of times I feel so weak, wondering why things have turned out this way, or imagining negative events. Then I turned to myself and reminded that this is an opportunity to grow and to dis-identify with the minds. It's so negative that it wants to kill me. When I'm free of the mind, I feel love and there is no problem at all. Things happen when there are mind attacks.
