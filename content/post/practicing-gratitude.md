Recently I've been writing the 5-minute gratitude journal. It's a daily blog of mine containing only positive things I'm grateful for. Though it's really short, it's still better than writing nothing. While my friends have Facebook and Instagram surfing routine, I have journaling routine and it offers a greater return than passively consuming social media.

Since I broke away from my previous relationship a few weeks ago, I've learned to discover things and do things to heal, instead of indulging in things that have little value. So I write gratitude journal every day, read more books and meditate a lot. I'm becoming more positive and grateful and I feel great. This makes me realize everything can be taught. I'm not a static self.
