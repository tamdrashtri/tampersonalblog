What happens when I start meditation is that when it comes to thoughts, it's hard to not fantasizing or thinking of negative things in life. I've been trying to find a framework on how to deal with it. 

Thoughts are often full of egoistic thinking, designing for our ultimate disappointment when it's not fulfilled. We often fantasize about things that aren't real at all, like I was a month ago when my ex started not contacting me again. It's really not healthy, and often it's pulling toward negativity.

I just realized if I continue to believe what I think and dream, my life would turn into misery and disappointment. No happiness can be found with this. I will be hurt, that's just the fact of life.

So right now I'm practicing the art of ignoring the mind. Whatever the mind thinks I will take a distance. I don't need to believe it, and as Mooji said, thoughts are like fogs. It's not necessary to believe in it.
