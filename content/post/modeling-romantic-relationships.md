A person

* Crush a person
* Fall in love and drown in it
* The world is perfect, everything is perfect. Only love exist
* Then it comes expectations
* The other person starts to do things that are out of expectations. Or things happen that hinder the growth and the possibility of love.
* Disappointment or try to stabilize
* Start slowly and look for alternatives
* Fall in love with another person
* The cycle begins again

Assumptions

* Start with love feeling alone. Live mostly in the emotional world
* Only think of attractiveness without consider whether the other person is compatible or not
