title = "Ways to feel great: #1 Complete something every day"

+++
Recently, I notice I feel anxious when I'm taking online courses and have not completed a homework task I've expected of the day. This makes me think about the homework until I sit down and commit to finishing it. After that, my whole day is relieved. I can do whatever I want.

A sense of completion feels great. And I realize I should complete things more often. Cooking, making something, exercise, write a blog post. This builds up a sense of satisfaction, and it's rewarding. Especially when I'm able to share it with others. 

Completing things I've worked on is one of my long-term goals for this reason. Often completing is not easy. A lot of challenges and struggles go along the way and block us. Take the Excel class I did for example. It takes me about 3 months to complete it, 2 months in this period I abandoned the course because I was stuck on a problem and could not finish the quiz. Now I'm completing the specialization and feel greater than ever. I'll reward myself something big once I completed this course series. 

The lesson is: just don't give up. If challenges or obstacles come along the way, just accept the sense of not being able to understand. Once you re-read, tinker and try ways to solve the problems, solutions will appear much easier.
