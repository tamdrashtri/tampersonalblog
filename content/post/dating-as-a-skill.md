I'd think not a small amount of people around me, some are my friends, avoid dating or they are not good at this dating skill. I'd say it's a skill to be developed and learn. Flirting is interesting because you care about others, you're interested in others and you try to become interesting. It's really is a good skill to learn.

Whether I'm a friend or a partner with someone or not really depends on how I present and act. The world is like a stage. It pushes me to constantly acting. The question is, how can I trust this person or not. How can I know if they would be a good partner. I have to deal with a lot of uncertainty.

Dating is very much a spiritual lesson. It forces us to know how to regulate ourselves. If we go too extreme we're screwed. We have to be subtle, flirting, know how to behave ourselves and see the goodness in others. How to maintain a relationship is also another important challenge.

Sometimes I'm not sure how a person ends up having a relationship with others while being like this, or like that. I have to question myself as well. A lot of my behaviors are not well observed.

I used to be so remorse over a relationship that's not worth it. This time exactly one year ago I still have some feeling for Chi. Now it's all gone. And feeling for Phuong as well. It's fast and furious and it ended. It taught me important lessons on how to behave, how to be present and improve myself. Like how to make attempt to clean my room, to be more responsible... It's challenging since it's not my second nature.

Having a relationship is good in a way that the other person becomes a monitor. They would help us look into ourselves because they observe and judge us at the same time. We're emotional beings. Somehow we are unpredictable and not well regulated in our behaviors. I'd see some old people looking into me while I'm on the bus and might judging me because I smile on the phone. Yes that's true. My behaviors are not so well regulated.
