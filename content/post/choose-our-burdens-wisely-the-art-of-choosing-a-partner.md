Having a partner is both a curse and a blessing. We're all imperfect creatures. We screw up, do bad things that harm us, say dishonest things and impel to make impulsive acts that hurt others. It takes either courage or blindness to take in one other person as a partner. We criticize others as not matching our expectations, while we are imperfect ourselves.

I see so many people harming themselves in a long term with their diet and habits. They eat too much meat and too little vegs, eat out too much and cook so little, do nothing to improve their social skills, accept being overweight and have a low-level job, and do little to clean and organize their houses. And I was one of those people. Following people's advice to accept myself and I feel nothing was wrong with my behaviors for many years until I'm aware of my imperfections.

What I mean is, if I allow myself to date one person who is like that, very much likely I'd be like them, adopting bad habits. Because they influence me. Meeting them every day, talking with them every few hours - it's hard to avoid not being influenced.

It'll be much nicer to have a partner to grow with us and rise us to be better. Finding them takes time. Get rid of those who don't deserve our love. It's not worth it. I'll be much better off.
