Find the problem to work on is even more important than the technical skills I have. That's why Eric is a manager. He finds the problem and tells me where to look for data. I'm just a technician. Seem like I'm using extremely easy data but it still takes so much time to clean it up. I feel inferior. Remember there are software engineers who are hired just to fix bugs. So I should not complain since my humiliation is nothing compared to these people. Or customer support people, yes. Not having technical skills can be a blessing but also a curse. You might have to face with a lot of customer issues while not developing your career capital involving these technical skills.

Deep learning does have very cool applications. What I'm interested more instead is reinforcement learning. It's just that I don't have enough ability to learn it yet. Have to learn basic Python first. Then I could think of other things.

Udacity gives me a tons of resources where I can learn this shit. Super expected to learn all these shit. From there I can leverage even more. Also it will help to find all the problem statement for data analysis in business. Once I understand both business and data analysis, I'll be unstoppable. The great thing about being a data person is that I can understand how the company works in general, though I might not now what the HR person does, or what other people do specifically. Just the data. But it's quite enough.
