+++
There're two types of people in the world: those who focus on others' mistakes and those who focus on their own blindspots.

It's not easy to recognize one's own blindspots, mainly because we're miserable at observing ourselves. Interacting more with others and receiving feedback from them might help. Expand one's knowledge in spirituality might help. Having a roommate or a romantic partner might help. A good boss helps too. One just needs to be responsive to feedback and feel appreciated when it happened. 

I'd admit I was lazy and unorganized in the past. I don't think I've turned totally clean and organized yet I'm much better now. I make time to clean the floor, to cook and reorganize stuff. And I'm more willing to do these thing.
