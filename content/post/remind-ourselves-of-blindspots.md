+++
There're two types of people in the world: those who focus on others' mistakes and those who focus on their own blindspots.

It's not easy to recognize one's own blindspots, mainly because we're miserable at observing ourselves. Interacting more with others and receiving feedback from them might help. Expand one's knowledge in spirituality might help. Having a roommate or a romantic partner might help. A good boss helps too. One just needs to be responsive to feedback and feel appreciated when it happened.

I'd admit I was lazy and unorganized in the past. I don't think I've turned totally clean and organized yet I'm much better now. I make time to clean the floor, to cook and reorganize stuff. And I'm more willing to do these chores.

All of these might be because of my break up. It made me become aware in a lot of things from the feedbacks I received. I don't say I'm awaken but it makes me see myself as someone who could improve themselves and become a better partner in the future. I made a lot of mistakes alone the way. No doubt I'm still so immature.

The willingness to do something has energy in it. It changes our behaviors in fundamental ways. I was so reluctant learning to cook, now I feel fun whenever I cook. I hated cleaning and organizing my room, now I clean and become more aware of my clothes' organization. And know what? All of these things benefit me. I've changed at least some of my personality. I'm transforming. And this makes life much more satisfying.

When one realizes they are still very much immature, there's a great energy coming forth, the will to change oneself. It can be as powerful as an atomic bomb.
