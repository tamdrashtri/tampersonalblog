I read a lot of blogs on writing, and I'm inspired a lot by them. Yet I mostly write privately. I used to design a blog using Webflow but could not maintain it because writing articles on that site is not a very pleasant user experience. So I postponed. Until I decided very recently that I want a static site for blogging. This is to minimize cost. I was not expected I become addicted to blogging this much.

Here I want to share some blogs I found very inspiring. They have provided me ideas and lessons to start and maintain a writing habit:
