I read a lot of blogs on writing, and I'm inspired a lot by them. Yet I mostly write privately. I used to design a blog using Webflow but could not maintain it because writing articles on that site is not a very pleasant user experience. So I postponed. Until I decided very recently that I want a static site for blogging. This is to minimize cost. I was not expected I become addicted to blogging this much.

Here I want to share some blogs I found very inspiring. They have provided me ideas and lessons to start and maintain a writing habit:

Some people do write a lot despite being busy, having a full time job, or having a kid even. Just imagine how hard it is for Paul Kalanithi to write his memoir and experiences in times of cancer. I guess it was extremely hard for him. Yet he has no other motivations other than to write. It's a form of therapy and ways for people to remember him. At least he is not forgotten.

When people were loving long-distance with no forms of internet, how would they know if someone is having another person or not? It would be so painful to give so much hope to a person who is going to marry, yet when we come back home then we realize the person we love is already with another person.

Doing something is a form of therapy itself. I consider it essential. Doing something actively. Learning something too.

Having a good app for writing helps a lot in the process, like this Forestry thing. They make the writing experience so much more pleasant.

But, why blog? Not many blog. The amount of cook versus bloggers are very unbalanced toward cooks. It's time consuming also. Can take hours per day to write a blog or find an idea. 

Besides a day-to-day job, what I found is people lack a form of sharing. I have two apartment-mates at the moment, and
