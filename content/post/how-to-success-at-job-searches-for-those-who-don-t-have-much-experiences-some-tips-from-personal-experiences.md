+++
In college I wasn't strategic in my job searches. I had no LinkedIn, did little or nothing to prepare for my internships. Part of it was because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. It was only at the end of my fourth year I began to pay more attention to my online professional presence. I started this blog and polished my LinkedIn more. It was not easy at first since I feel uncomfortable presenting myself in public. It got easier over time. I became feeling natural with my online professional self. I don't say it was easy. It takes time given being an introvert like me.

After college, I thought basically having some projects at hand I can apply for jobs and show my high-level skills in data analytics. It wasn't working that way. Most recruiters did not pay much attention to the projects I've done. A lot of them instead look for my experiences. It could not talk much about me. I was in college doing internships I have little to no prior education. Most of them involve doing non-sensical work that I was not comfortable, but just for explorations. I want to explore different career paths involving design, then I realized it's becoming saturated over time. Most likely to fall in a particular pattern. I know it's even more realistic than what I've studied on like economics or all sorts of natural sciences classes, yet I feel there needs to be something more than that. So postpone my art pursuit for later.

I started applying for jobs.
