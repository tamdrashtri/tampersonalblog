### Notes

How digital has changed marketing:

* Whatever the size of your company,whatever the size of your marketing spend,you can compete with the bigger players.
* You can have new players come into those sectors and do things differently and disrupt the sector, even though they're not well established, even though they don't have brand recognition, even though they don't have a huge marketing budget. They can achieve incredible things.
* Word of mouth is another great example of this, right.There's always been word of mouth recommendation,it's the holy grail, isn't it, of marketing.The actually you don't have to spend a lot of money on marketing because people recommend your products from one person to another.Now, in the digital age,word of mouth has been amplified.
* digital provides us with an unprecedented amount of data.And that needs to fundamentally change how we approach things.Imagine for a moment if that printed brochure that you got done, you knew every time somebody opened it.You knew how long they were looking at it.You knew which pages of the brochure they looked at and for how long

In traditional marketing we don't know if it works or not:

* Traditional marketing doesn't factor in these unique characteristics of digital.Traditional marketing still is about broadcasting a message.But digital allows us as well to listen and respond to users and questions.We can adapt based on what we see them doing. 
* Traditional marketing is very campaign orientated and as a result that hassome fundamental flaws to it, right.If you think about a traditional campaign cycle,it begins with a premise for the campaign,what's that campaign about?But is that premise validated in any way?Not normally, we might do a little bit of market research but that's basically it.It's somebody's idea about what might work.We don't know whether it will work or not.

So what's user centric marketing?

* We use a centric marketing drawson user research and user experience design.It draws on these fieldsand the things that we've learned in these fieldsto bring marketing into the 21st centuryor at least, let's be more honest,bring marketing project managementand the way we approach campaigns into the 21st century.It seeks to use digital tools to better understand usersand their journey so thatwe design our marketing strategy around them.It also looks at ways to validate our approach to a campaignat every step of the way.It aims to adapt our campaigns once they're launchedto maximize their effectiveness

##### How to better understand your audience without spending a cent

Ways to find user's data:

* Existing research: what we're going to do, is we're going to start by finding any existing research that already exists within your organization.Now, when you do find it,you'll discover that maybe not all of it is up to date,and that's okay, and we'll deal with that.And, it might be that not all of that research you've got actually is that relevant, and that's okay too,but we need to know what we've got before we start getting anything new
* Sales team: Our sales team have contact with the customer every single day,they're always out there talking to customers.So they will know in their heads a huge amount about their customers.They'll know about where they work,they'll know about questions that they've got,and most significantly, what objections they have,what reasons do they give for not buying?Because those are the kinds of things that we can be addressing in our marketing and sales strategies.So our sales people will give you amazing insights,they'll also have things like testimonials from customers,and all kinds of insights into who they are,and what they're trying to achieve.What are their goals?What are their pain points?
* SEO tools: you can find often that peopleare using slightly different terminologythan maybe the terminology used on your website,and so you won't be able to see from your search termsthat those are relevant questions,but using a good search engine optimization tool,that will reveal to you other questions,other related terms to the ones that you're already using.The other thing you can learn from analyticsis where people are giving their most of their attention when they visit your website
* Social media update: We push out social media updates in the world,and only give superficial attention to things like shares and likes.But the kind of things that people share and like are also good indication of what they care about.The final analytic source that you need to be looking atis things like session recorders and heatmap tools.

It's impossible to convince somebody to do somethingunless you know them, right?Think about any time you triedto persuade a person personally to do anything.The better you know them, the easier it is to convince them.So unsurprisingly, we need to really know our usersif we want them to take action.The better we know them,the easier it is to persuade them to do something.And that means we really need to get to know our audience,not just what their tastes are,not that they have 2.3 children and drive an Audi,but we need to understand what they're trying to achieve,what their goals are, all of those kinds of things
