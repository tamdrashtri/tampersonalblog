I think kindness is somewhat underrated. 

Kindness is not easy at all when something turns bad, or when someone treats you badly without proper explanations. The gut feeling is usually to revenge back and make the other feels miserable. This happened quite so often in relationships, especially intimate ones. Because they are often the ones who are likely to hurt us the most.

It needs tremendous courage and vulnerability to be kind, in these scenarios. Often one needs to get rid of their gut emotions and open oneself to vulnerability. 

So I heard someone has said "kindness is more important than wisdom". I agree with it. Because kindness requires actions. Wisdom is difficult to measure. Your thoughts might be full of wisdom but you do not act on it, then it's not worth to be counted.

One of my life goals, therefore, is to be more kind. It's a great practice I want to cultivate in my life.
