I took Chris Voss's masterclass on negotiation by subscribing to a 1-year access pass on Masterclass. I'd say this is a very good price to pay for world-class education. Their workshops would cost at least $4k/person and their on-demand course is more than $1.3k for a one-year subscription.

I finished the course within a few hours, since it's so engaging. The way he teaches is very practical and he also does mock negotiations so he can exercises his skills, not just talking about theories. College classes are often based on theories and not so much on applications. This makes it harder to apply the skills and how to exercise them into the real world.

The skills he taught I do want to keep notes as I want to practice them in everyday life. My summary here:

#### Better to ask [no-oriented questions](https://blog.blackswanltd.com/the-edge/3-ways-to-make-no-work-for-you):

Instead of asking "what" or "how" questions, you're asking people to say yes. Instead of that, ask:

* “Is it ridiculous...?”
* “Would it be horrible…?”
* “Is it a bad idea...?”
* “Have you given up on…?”

> Just change your “yes-oriented” questions – “Is it ok if we sit in the reserved section of the restaurant?” to “no-oriented” questions – “Would it be horrible if we sat there?”

It'll be quite awkward in the beginning since very few people say things like this. I'd say it'll get more familiar with time.

#### Creating "I" message 

Simply state this:

When you ... I feel/it seems ... Because ...

Saying what one feels creates a safe environment rather than being confrontational.

#### Respond to a lie:

When someone lies to you, some words you can say:

1. Seems like there is sth here I missed.
2. Seems like there are more here than meet the eyes

#### The accusations audit
