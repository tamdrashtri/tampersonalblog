I read the letter I send to myself a few days ago. I realized some parts of me did not change. I still love meditation and feel compelled to do it every day. But in terms of emotion, it comes and goes. It matters less and less through time. When emotions are elicited at this moment it might feel really strong. Now I could not remember the details of it.

It makes sense to not trust my emotions very much. Right now I might feel so in love or so angry but it lessens over time. What is important now is the presence, and it needs practice to feel so.

Yet some people change over night, and they experience their true self in complete harmony. Like Eckhart Tolle, he was suffering so much, did not have any girlfriend and was too shy. He suffered from depression too and he suddenly changed in one moment. It needs no time to be awaken. The sense of peace flowed into him for no reason. This was when he figured out he could not bear with his current self no longer.

This makes me realize there is no need worry too much about the self. They just create stories for me to believe in and I trust them too much. Often they produce negative thoughts and impulses that make me feel miserable after that act. I should not trust it no longer.
