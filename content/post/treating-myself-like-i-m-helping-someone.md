I feel strange lately because I care about myself a lot. It's often because I'd never go to a dentist if I don't feel problems with my teeth. Usually I will only eat healthy if I realize I have health issues, or go to a doctor if I feel sick. Now I do a regular check-up to take care of myself. Isn’t it weird?

I don’t know if this is an improvement or not, but I will take it as something my future self could be proud of, and she will feel grateful of it.

I’m surprised to even realize how much people ignore their health, until they collapsed and go to the hospital. Often it’s too late too strange. Just like I’m hesitant to go to the gym even if I’ve heard so many good things about the benefits of exercises. I just couldn’t exert myself.

This goes back to an idea I’ve been reading about lately - the idea of treating myself like someone whom I’m responsible for helping. I read this from Jordan Peterson. This resonates with me simply because I often see people not taking care of themselves that much, either by eating junk food, or sun bathing until they suffer from the whole body sunburn.

This resonates with the idea of beginning treating oneself like a partner. Cooking for myself, or going on a date with myself. It might sound awkward, but really it’s the art of being single ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-art-of-being-single](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-art-of-being-single "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-art-of-being-single")). It also comes from a realization that I will eventually will be alone, at some points in life. To be fine, I need to treat myself like a loved one.

Now that I’m aware of it, I will take steps so I can take care of myself in better ways so my future self would feel happy.
