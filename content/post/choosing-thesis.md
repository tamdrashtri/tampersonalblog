title: "Lessons learned choosing my thesis topic"
---

I hesitated for many months deciding the topic I want to write for my thesis, both because of the conflict of interests, or whether I want something that is practical or just inherently for fun. I decided then to write something that is practical, something that I can practice my skills and improve on it. 
‍

My mentor advised me to write a literature review of the topic I’m interested in and consider that a thesis. If just a thesis then I’m not training the skills I really want. 
‍

So I had been thinking about what types of projects should I do, then I decided to tackle churn, which is about customer retention and it's relevant to business. It's more than helpful because it really allows me to pitch about it to potential employers. 
‍

So then I realized if I don't really have ideas on what to write about, the criteria I should choose are high impact problems from the point of view of society's demand, instead of just trying to figure out a problem in vain. 


Also many students I know chose topics that are from their prof's ideas,but I feel their professors' ideas can be interesting just on a very small level, sometimes of a personal interest and might not be marketable once they graduate. 
‍

I don't feel very regret by now choosing my thesis topic as a quite common business problem. It helps me to think about businesses in a binocular way and focuses on customers and their interests. And yes, my thesis topic would sound really perverted to a lot of people at Quest who are interested in social justice and hard sciences. I'm among the minority one, but it doesn't matter. My focus is different and career goals are different, so of course we are in different paths. But I can feel strongly now if I could chose a university again I'd never chose Quest given the differences of values. I don't know if I've changed for the better or not. But I'm glad that at least I have changed.
