**Eat mostly raw and unprocessed foods**, except when cooking increases nutrient availability.

**Eat many colors of fruits and veggies.**

**Don't go on diets**, except for obvious "diets" like eating less or no junk food. Don't actively try to lose weight, since your body is likely to rebound afterwards. If you lose weight at all (which is unlikely), it should happen naturally as part of your regular lifestyle.

**Avoid burned toast, french fries, etc.** "Acrylamide can form in some foods when they are fried or baked. These foods include potatoes, cereals, coffee, crackers, breads, and dried fruits, according to the FDA. \[...\] The agency also advised consumers to avoid crisping or burning sliced potatoes and to toast bread and bagels to a light brown rather than dark brown color. Potatoes should be stored in a dark pantry — rather than the refrigerator — to reduce the amount of acrylamide formed during cooking."

**Avoid nutmeg (or eat only small amounts).** "It takes a fair amount of nutmeg — two tablespoons or more — before people start exhibiting symptoms." ([source](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/a-warning-on-nutmeg/?_r=0 '"A Warning on Nutmeg"'))

**I try to spit out apple seeds, but eating a few is ok as long as they're not chewed.**Chewing and swallowing lots of apple seeds is unhealthy. Eating a bowl of apple seeds is dangerous.
