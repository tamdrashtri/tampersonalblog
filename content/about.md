title: About

My favorite book is [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile). I love Stefan Zweig's novels. And my book log is available on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16499362-tam-nguyen).

My personal philosophy:

* Be kind no matter what. Everyone has ups and downs and it's silly if I feel jealous of people's lives.
* Persistence beats intelligence. Though it might be a cliche, if I just don't give up and work on meaningful things every day, I can accomplish most things.
* Sharing is king. I've learned that from my [sister](https://tamhn.me/lesson-from-sister/).

Things I care about (for now):

* Personal finance
* Architecture
* Design, including game design, UX and UI
* Poetry
